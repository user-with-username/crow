# Crow Build System - Overview

Crow is a modern C++ build system designed for simplicity and efficiency. It provides:
- Declarative configuration format
- Dependency management
- Parallel builds
- Incremental compilation
- Pre-build hooks

Key characteristics:
- Single configuration file (`crow.toml`)
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Profile-based builds (debug/release)
- Target-specific configurations
- Global and local dependency caching

Ideal for:
- Small to medium C++ projects
- Cross-platform development
- Projects with external dependencies
