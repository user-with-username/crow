// hey, ya read this? thanks u for using CRow. btw, this tool has been written by me in 2 weeks (i created the first working prototype in 1 week, and in the second one i fixed some architecture troubles and little bugs). i dont think crow become popular, but i hope it can be useful for at least a few people who need a simple build tool for their projects
